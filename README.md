Powerful yet easy to use datagrid for PHP/MySQL

MySqlGrid generates a sortable, searchable, paginated datagrid from any valid MySQL "Select" statement.  Each column is given an input field in which the user can enter a substring that forms a filter on the rows returned.  If the user selects the drop down icon for a column MySqlGrid dyanamically builds a select element from the unique values for that column for the current result set.
